# Rights & Publication Policy

This repository distributes original materials (preprints, working papers, notes, argument maps, tests, and supporting artifacts) under the license stated in `LICENSE`.

If a Version of Record (VoR) is later published by a journal or press, that VoR may be subject to different terms. This repository will not redistribute the VoR unless explicitly permitted by the publisher. Instead, the canonical reference (DOI/URL) will be linked from `README.md`.

Repository materials remain citable and versioned through `CHANGELOG.md` and `CITATION.cff`.
