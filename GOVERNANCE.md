# Governance

## Versioning (SemVer)
- MAJOR: changes to Core definitions/invariants that break downstream compatibility.
- MINOR: additive changes without breaking invariants.
- PATCH: editorial changes without doctrinal impact.

## Release language
English is the canonical release language. Spanish appears only as provenance snapshots at release points (Model B).

## Minimum release gate (v0.1.0)
A repository is releaseable if it contains:
- LICENSE, RIGHTS.md, CITATION.cff, CHANGELOG.md
- and at least one English artifact (`*.en.md`) appropriate to its role.

## Accountability
Human author is responsible for commitments (definitions, norms, conclusions).
AI contributions should be recorded in AI_CONTRIBUTION_LOG.md when used.
